					<span class="text-primary">Chelsea!</span></h1>
					<p class="lead mb-5"><p>My name is Chelsea Bragg. I am 27 years old, and I currently live in Townsville, QLD.</p>
<p>I am English/Australian with my father and his family hailing from Somerset, England and my mother and her family from Townsville, QLD.</p>
<p>My highest level of education is QCE. I had planned to step into university straight out of high school, but I did not feel I was ready. And so, I decided to pack up and move to London by myself, where I worked as a project administrator for a few years before I moved back to Australia due to health issues with my mother.</p>
<p>After moving back to Australia, I got a job at Telstra working in their Platinum sector, offering very basic IT support to their customers. A couple of years in, I felt a bit lost and packed up and moved to Sydney, where I worked for Ausgrid in their Emergency Contact Centre as the Social and Multimedia Liaison as well as an Emergency Operator when necessary.</p>
<p>Earlier last year, just before the severity of COVID-19 was established, I was offered a role in Townsville, similar to the role I was doing at the time. I moved back to Townsville, ready to start my new job. However, two weeks later, due to COVID-19 worsening in Australia, my employment was placed on hold and subsequently terminated.</p>
<p>I have since been working as an Educator at an Early Learning Daycare Centre. A job that I enjoy but am not overly passionate about and never necessarily imagined myself in, which is why I have decided to enrol with RMIT, to pursue something I am passionate about.
<p>Outside of IT, I enjoy drawing and learning Japanese.</p>

					<span class="text-primary">IT</span></h1>
					<p class="lead mb-5"><p><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</strong></p>
          <p>From as early as I can remember, I have always had an interest in IT. When I was younger, about 11 years old, my family had this brick of a computer in the living room. It was prehistoric and had the screech of dial-up internet. I would sit on it for hours playing the PC mini-games that used to come with happy meals from McDonald's as other games used to cost too much for my single mother of 6 kids. One day the computer stopped working and would not load past the initial boot screen. We could not afford to have someone look at it to fix it so I would go and use the local library computers. One day at the library, I decided to search Google for reasons as to why it would not turn on. I would find articles and take notes and go back home and try some of the suggestions. One of the articles suggested that the tower might have been hit, and the hard drive knocked loose, so I decided to try and take the computer apart to check. With the help of some pictures printed from the library, I was able to locate the hard drive and make sure it was connected securely. After putting everything back together, I tried to turn the computer on, and it worked. I was so excited and had such a feeling of accomplishment. Ever since that moment, I have always opted to try and fix any IT issues I had of my own as well as any friends or family members.</p>
          <p>Other than a few IT classes in high school and a couple of years working offering the most basic of IT troubleshooting, I have not entered any formal training, which is something that I have always wanted to do, and I believe now is the right time in my life to do so.</p>
          <p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
          <p>I chose to enrol with RMIT via OUA as it offered me a flexible pathway to enter an undergraduate degree in IT. I was also drawn to the fact that I could complete the degree 100% online whilst still getting the most out of what RMIT has to offer.</p>
          <p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
          <p>Ultimately, from this course, I hope to improve my IT skills significantly. I will then be able to apply those skills and pursue a career within the IT industry.</p>

					<p class="lead mb-5"><p><p><strong>Position Description</strong></p>
          <p>Figuring out what my ideal job would be has been a challenge. Mostly due to the vast number of options available in the IT field. I have always been fascinated with the ins and outs of how a game comes to be, from the code that drives the game to the visual aspects. I knew my ideal job would include some form of this.</p>
          <p>Taking this into account, my ideal job would be Game Programmer, offered through Digital Waffle, as shown above and <a href="https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/gameprogrammer/42283815?source=searcgResukts#game-jobs" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>
          <p>This role requires the applicant to possess various skills and experience across a range of fields to support the development of game code and Unreal projects. The applicant would be assisting in several proprietary projects as well as collaborating with high profile partners. </p>
          <p>This role appealed to me as it gives me the chance to utilise my own skills and knowledge whilst also working with a range of IT disciplines. </p>
          <p><strong>Required Skills, Qualifications and Experience</strong></p>
          <p>In order to be eligible for this role, I would need to demonstrate a strong understanding of programming languages, specifically C++. I would also need to show excellent comprehension when it comes to an understanding of Unreal Engine tools, including but not limited to 4 blueprint logic and gameplay logic assemblies.</p>
          <p>In addition to technical capabilities, I would also need to be a quick learner with high attention to detail. I would also need strong interpersonal skills to ensure effective communication and collaboration with colleagues and clients to ensure the smooth delivery of a project.</p>
          <p><strong>My Current Skills, Qualifiactions and Experience</strong></p>
          <p>Currently, I possess strong interpersonal skills, having developed these throughout my schooling and career. I would also already consider myself a fast learner with high attention to detail.
          <p>Currently, my technical skills are minimal, as the skills I do have are mostly self-taught, often as a result of research after fixing a problem that has arisen.</p>
          <p><strong>How Will I Gain the Required Skills, Qulaifiactions and Experience</strong></p>
          <p>To be successful in my ideal job, I will need to build on my technical abilities, particularly around C++ and Unreal Engine. I will also need to expand and build on my knowledge of all aspects of IT in order to effectively contribute to projects.</p>
          <p>To create a foundation level of the understandings of IT and to build my programming skills, I will complete the Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT. I also plan to expand my knowledge by using online training tools such as www.udemy.com and courses available through www.unrealengine.com.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5"><p><p><strong><u>16Personalities</u></strong></p>
          <p>My 16Personalities results indicate that I am an INFJ-A or an Advocate. An advocate can be described as someone who will either stand up for their ideals with great passion and conviction or, at times, be soft-spoken and understated rather than challenging. Because of this blend of traits, an Advocate is considered one of the more rare personality types.</p>
          <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
          Creative, Insightful, Principled, Passionate, Altruistic</p>
          <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
         Sensitive to Criticism, Reluctant to Open Up, Perfectionist, Avoiding the Ordinary, Prone to Burnout</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5"><p><p><strong><u>How to Study</u></strong></p>
          <p>How to Study states that I am considered a Visual Learner. Visual Learners like to see what they are learning and prefer the means of written language, images, or diagrams. Visual Learners also take cues from facial expressions and body language when differentiating what is and is not important.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5"><p><p><strong><u>Hogwarts House Sorting</u></strong></p>
          <p><p><i>“You might belong in Hufflepuff, where they are just and loyal, those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil.” J.K Rowling.</i></p>
          <p>According to the Wizarding World House Sorting, I am a Hufflepuff. Considered one of the more inclusive houses, Hufflepuffs are known to be dedicated, patient and loyal. With a strong moral code and sense of right and wrong, they are known to value everyone and treat them as equal. Hufflepuffs nature can be exemplified by its mascot, the Badger, which can appear quiet and harmless, but if provoked, can become vicious, fighting off attackers twice its size.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5"><p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
          <p>Although I am highly sceptical of these types of personality tests and believe they should be taken with a grain of salt, I was quite surprised to find how much I resonated with some of the information. People that know me would describe me as quiet, understated, potentially timid. But the people who really know me also know that I am a fierce friend and can stand up for myself and others where necessary.</p>
          <p>I do not, however, consider myself a Visual Learner. Although visuals certainly help when learning, I believe I thrive off a combination of auditory, tactile, <i><strong>and</i></strong> visual learning.</p>
          <p>As these results indicate, I believe that in a team setting, I will be open, observant, and respectful to other team members suggestions and opinions but may hold myself back when it comes to my own opinions. In a group setting, this can be a hinderance, so I will need to ensure that I am communicating openly and effectively with my team members.</p>

            					<h1 class="mb-0">Project
            					<span class="text-primary">Idea</span></h1>
            					<p class="lead mb-5"></p><p></p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                      <p>This project will see the development of a smartphone application (iOS and Android) that will provide users with the tools to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing their average household food wastage.</p>
                      <p>A range of tools will be provided to users that will allow them to plan meals efficiently and create shopping lists based on the contents of their fridge, freezers, and pantry. By doing so users would only be purchasing what is required for those meals.</p>
                      <p>Educational resources concerning food waste will also be provided. These resources would include tips as well as links to organisations that offer more sustainable products and services for consumers. This application currently has a work in progress title of Fridge Friend.</p>
                      <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
                      <p>Globally, one-third of the world's food is wasted. This waste accounts for eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind the US and China.</p>
                      <p>In Australia alone, food waste accounts for more than five per cent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Around 7.3 million tonnes of food is wasted annually. This waste is equal to about 300 kg per person or one in five bags of groceries. That is about $3,800 worth of groceries per household per year.</p>
                      <p>As reducing food waste is the third most effective way to address climate change, users can utilise the 'Fridge Friend' to efficiently track the life cycle of their food inventory.</p>
                      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
                      <p>Fridge Friend is an application designed to assist users in managing their food waste ny making use of tools such as meal plannners and intuitive grocery lists. The concept of this application is that by utilising these tools, only ingredients required for those meals are purchased, resulting in reduced food waste. Additionally, the application will have easy to follow tips and tricks to allow adjustments to the users lifestlye that will make a change to landfill contribution as a result of food waste and raise environmental awareness that will hopefully, in turn, encourage consumer decisions in all aspects of life. To further aid users in making those decisions, the application will provide information on companies that source sustainable alternatives and products , e.g. Bulk food store, local markets and farms.</p>
                      <p>The application will feature the following functions:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Meal planner</li>
                      <li>Fridge, freezer and pantry inventory</li>
                      <li>Food waste calculator</li>
                      <li>Shopping list</li>
                      <li>Recipe datbase</li>
                      <li>Tips on how to make more environmentally friendly choices</li>
                      <li>Information on current environmental pressures</li>
                      <li>Links to sustainable stores/organisations</li>
                      <li>Reward system, e.g. badges for completing milestones/goals</li>
                      </ul>


                      <p>The meal planner provides users with the ability to plan a number of meals ranging from weekly meal prep, mid-week meals to dinner parties. When using the meal planner, user will be able indicate that they have prepared a meal. This information will then be used to update some of the other features offered, as listed below.</p>
                      <p>The pantry, fridge, and freezer inventory tool will allow users to record their pantry, fridge and freezer contents accurately. The user will have the ability to either enter this information manually or utilise the built-in label scanner that uses the product's barcode to locate the item. The intuitiveness of this feature means that each time a meal is indicated as prepared, the quantity of ingredients used in the meal is then reflected in the inventory in real-time.</p>
                      <p>A food waste calculator will also be available. Any food that users are not able to utilise or compost can be input to the calculator and based on the type and amount of food, the calculator will return a result in the form of Emissions of CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent). Users will than be able to track, in real-time the impact of their own personal food waste.</p>
                      <p>The shopping list feature will automatically determine the ingredients required for a recipe. This would be done by utlising the inventory feature to determine if the user already has some of the ingredients to hand. To assist in keeping the inventory updated, users will be have the option to use a ‘commit’ function that will then move those items from the shopping list to the inventory, updating existing stock quantities.</p>
                      <p>The recipe function will allow users to search a database of existing recipes or create/upload their own recipes to the application.</p>
                      <p>The tips and tricks section will include an array of information from collated from current environmental statistics and data. The purpose of this feature is to provide users with information on the realities of the impact food waste can potentially have on the environment, motivating them to take that impact into account when making decisions. This section will also include information how to live a more sustainable lifestyle, providing tips such as buying in bulk, utilising alternative items like glass/silicone straws to eliminate its single-use counterparts or how to compost produce so that it does not end up in landfill.</p>
                      <p>Users will also be provided with links and information to stores and organisations that provide sustainable products. Thes include grocery stores, products, recycling centres or even food rescue organisations, for example, Foodbank, OzHarvest, bulk food stores, local markets and farms.</p>
                      <p>The application will also feature a rewards system in the form of reward badges. These badges would be issued to the user for completing tasks/reaching goals, acting as a positve motivator for the user to continue to use the application and make positive choices when in comes to food waste and sustainability.</p>
                      <p><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></p>
                      <p>As this project will be heavily code dependant, PC’s will be the primary hardware needed.</p>
                      <p>In order for this application to be compatible across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, mobile application building software would be. Apache Cordova or PhoneGap as it is now known, would be a great choice of software as it offers a range of features including the ability to target multiple platforms with one code and being open-source.</p>
                      <p><strong>Skills Required</strong></p>
                      <p>Overall, with the right skills and knowledge, this project is feasible.  To build this application, several different skillsets will be required. When it comes to mobile applications, perhaps the most important aspect, besides the contect, would be the UI. This is the first thing that the user will see and so needs to not only be user-friendy but aestetically pleasing and so UI design skills would be advantageous.</p>
                      <p>An understanding of programming languages will also be necessary, especillay if using PhoneGap as apps built with this software are based predominately off of HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
                      <p>A basic understanding of backend computingmay also be necessary for efficient database management as well as security implementation.</p>
                      <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
                      <p>The most tangible measure for this application's success would be the reduction of food waste not only by households, but potentially companies as well.</p>
                      <p>For example, it would be great if instead of filling multiple large dumpsters with edible produce <p>that then ends up in landfill, major grocery stores and fast-food restaurants could instead donate <p>this to food rescue organisations such as Foodwise or OzHarverst.</p>
                      <p>This application's ultimate end goal is to make enough of an impact so companies are influenced by the environmentally driven choices that users are making so that said companies re-think their current food waste strategies.</p>
                      <p>On an individual level, I hope that the lifestyle change will help the average user to find a deeper appreciation for their environment and the food that they consume.</p>
